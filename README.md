# Indeed Jobs Web Scraping and Analysis: Project Overview
-	Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from Indeed web pages
-	Visualized the companies and the locations with the highest number of job listings
-	Calculated the average minim and maxim salary 
-	Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on specific tools, platforms, skills, and data science roles
-	Created a word cloud highlighting the most frequently used words in job descriptions

The project uses Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup along with the Requests library to scrape and parse the job listings. NumPy and Pandas libraries are used for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and Natural Language Toolkit for text analysis.
